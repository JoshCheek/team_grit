# ===== The Minimalist =====
# For each method from the cheatsheet, write down its core ideas,
# write a piece of code that shows this idea,
# and uses as few characters as possible.
#
# For example, if you had to show Array#[], you could do:
#   a = []  # => []
#   a[0]    # => nil
#
# But to really be a minimalist, you'd want to inline the local variable
#   [][0]  # => nil
#
# Here are some other examples you might consider
#   [9,8][0]   # => 9
#   [9,8][1]   # => 8
#   [9,8][2]   # => nil
#   [9,8][-1]  # => 8
#   [9,8][-2]  # => 8

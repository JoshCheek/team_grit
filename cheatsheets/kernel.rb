# =====  Kernel  =====

# Kernel: Some methods don’t require a class name to be usable, such as lqpo. These
# are usually built-in, common methods that don’t have an obvious connection to any
# classes. Many of these methods are included in Ruby’s Kernal module, a module that
# provides functions that work from anywhere within Ruby code without being explicitly
# referred to.

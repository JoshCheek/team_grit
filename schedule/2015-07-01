1. Everyone make a new window, type out the three types of things in Ruby, as hashes, with their attributes.
2. What is everything here?
   def lol(lol)

Interim work
  * identify the similarities and differences between the different types of things we have available,
    reflect on the implications of this structure,
    is there anything we're missing? (I can think of 2)
  * Go over the refactoring kata we did yesterday

Afternoon?
  * simple things in complex context (array is an array, regardless of whether we call it `ARGV`)

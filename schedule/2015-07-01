1. Everyone make a new window, type out the three types of things in Ruby, as hashes, with their attributes.
2. What is everything here?
   def lol(lol)
     lol
   end
   lol = 123
   lol lol
3. What are the biggest inhibitors?
   (ie what do we want to spend the rest of our time on?)
4. Chisel via refactored bullshit.

Interim work
  * identify the similarities and differences between Classes, Instances, and Bindings,
    reflect on the implications of this structure,
    is there anything we're missing? (I can think of 1)
  * Redo the toplevel of chisel until you can do it in less than 5 minutes.

Afternoon?
  * simple things in complex context
    (array is an array, regardless of whether we call it `ARGV`)

----
Possible future exercises:
  * Exercises doing "write the toplevel without going down the rabbit hole"
    * Chess
    * Enigma
    * cat
  * Kata for enumerables
  * Modules and singleton classes?

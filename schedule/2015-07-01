1. Everyone make a new window, type out the three types of things in Ruby, as hashes, with their attributes.
2. What is everything here?
   def lol(lol)
     lol
   end
   lol = 123
   lol lol
3. What are the biggest inhibitors?
   (ie what do we want to spend the rest of our time on?)
4. Chisel via refactored bullshit.
   https://github.com/JoshCheek/team_grit/blob/master/quizzes/command_line.md#q19

Interim work
  * identify the similarities and differences between Classes, Instances, and Bindings,
    reflect on the implications of this structure,
    is there anything we're missing? (I can think of 1)
  * Redo the toplevel of chisel until you can do it in less than 5 minutes.

Afternoon?
  * simple things in complex context
    (array is an array, regardless of whether we call it `ARGV`)

Homework
  First 5 min tomorrow, y'all are going to rewrite the object model.
  So make sure you still have it down well enough to write it from memory again.

  Then try to write the programs `echo`, `cat`, and `wc`
  (descriptions here: https://github.com/JoshCheek/team_grit/blob/master/challenges/unix_utils.md

  I also updated our object model notes, here
  https://github.com/JoshCheek/team_grit/blob/master/cheatsheets_ruby/object_model.txt (edited)

  Also, reflect on what we did at the end there.
  What were the clues we used (think about the names).
  What might be some things you would expect to see if you went through the source code
  for something like https://github.com/stympy/faker, or https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems?

----
Possible future exercises:
  * Exercises doing "write the toplevel without going down the rabbit hole"
    * Chess
    * Enigma
    * cat
  * Kata for enumerables
  * Modules and singleton classes?

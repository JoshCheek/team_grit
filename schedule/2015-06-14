  Things to cover:
    Core:
      Enumerables:  be able to use the ones Ruby gives you, be able to implement your own.
      Ruby:         Array, Boolean, Class, Enumerable, File, IO, Kernel, Numeric, String
      Object Model
      Refactoring (using the object model to represent the same code in different ways)
    High Level:
      Top Down (book club)
      Breaking a problem down into a vision you can act on
      Design / Testing

  Approximately this week: Enumerables, Ruby
  Weekendish:              Object Model

  # Map method:     I can see the entire terrain (every path through learning, in this case)
  #                 I can see where I'm at on the map'
  #                 I can see where I want to be
  #                 I chart a path from where I'm at to where I want to be'
  #
  # Compass method: I don't necessarily know where I'm at
  #                 I don't necessarily know where I'm going
  #                 But I approximately know which direction it's in'
  #                 So I'm going to go that way'
  #                 Which gets me closer to where I want to be
  #
  # Compass method allows you to make progress every day :)
  # Progress aggregates surprisingly quickly :)

Independent Work
  1. Take a break
  2. Try to implement these:
    implement these enumerables:
      # reject
      # include?
      # all? {|obj| ... }
      # any? {|obj| ... }
      # none? {|obj| ... }
    Strategy:
      1. describe what they do in human words
         (you can figure this out by looking at http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Enumerable
         or play with calling them from the real Enumerable until you understand what they do)
      2. Make some examples: "If I call it with this array and this block, it will return this value"
      3. Write the method, and show that it works for each example.
    play with them a bit, like we did ("what if I did this?", then guess the outcome, then verify)
    be able to do them tomorrow

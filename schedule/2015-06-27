Weekend work!

I'll see y'all Monday morning at 10:30 AM to continue learning ^_^

1. Go over the quiz until you can do it in 15 min.

2. Do the inception games (notice the video on line 2,
   if you aren't sure what to do, watch that video to see me play them.
   https://github.com/JoshCheek/team_grit/blob/ca8d4c6ed31b8c2d5e66b8504ad6e9a79e6a4817/games/inception_games.rb)
   do it until you have a nightmare that is so big that it can't fit on your screen.
3. Go through the flow of this program we figured out:
   https://github.com/JoshCheek/team_grit/blob/ca8d4c6ed31b8c2d5e66b8504ad6e9a79e6a4817/katas/flow.rb
   correctly identifying the line numbers it hits, and what we will see on each line.
4. Go through the flow of this one, your goal the first time is to understand everything that you see.
   Once you achieve this goal, go through again, this time your goal is to get them all correct.
   Once you achieve this goal, go through again, this time your goal is to do them as fast as possible.
   Once you can do the whole thing in under 30 minutes, go through them again,
   with the goal of no errors and as fast as possible.
